USER STORY 1

Story: As a logged-in user, I want to be able to take a photo to find out my mood. 


Ideally, after logging on (fail1), user clicks a button which allows them to take a photo (Fail2). User confirms the upload 
and the app will return their date's mood (Fail3).

Failure points:

  Fail1: login fail - reset password
  
  Fail2: Can't take a photo - upload existing photo from device
  
  Fail3: App doesn't return mood - User sees error message, try to take or upload another photo
