As a user going on a date with someone I am unfamiliar with, I will open the app and login(user log in story). After logging in, 
I will take a photo of my date and upload it to the app. The app will return to me data of my date's mood from analyzing the
face of my date. If we are going to watch a movie, I can use the app again to suggests to me the best possible movies. The app will
give movie recommendation's that best fit my date's mood so we will have a good time together. I also want to be able to look 
back at the photos and moods of all the dates I brought and the movies that it recommended to me based on their moods at 
the time.
