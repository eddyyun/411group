As a user going to the movies, I will open the app and login(user log in story). After logging in, 
I will take a live photo or upload one to the app. The app will return to me the mood or emotion after analyzing my
face. The app will suggest to me the best possible movies. The app 
will give movie recommendation's that best fit my mood. I also want to be able to 
look back at previous moods and the movies that it recommended to me based on my moods at 
the time.
