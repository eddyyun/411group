We chose our stack after discussing different options and our experience with them. 
Everyone in our group has experience with Python so we decided to use Python instead of all of us learning the syntax, etc... of a different language. 
We chose MySQL because we thought a relational database would be best for our project in the long-term.
Additionally, we chose DJango because it is pretty intuitive and easy to use since it is MVC. It also provides us with the full stack.
