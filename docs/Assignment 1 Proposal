This is our proposal!

Proposal 1
The web application will serve as a recommendation tool for people looking to watch a movie. Using a picture posted by
the user, the web app will send the image to Google Vision API to detect and return the emotion detected for that particular 
person. The web app will then send these emotions to The Movie Database API to obtain recommendations on the
appropriate movies.

APIs:
Google Vision API 
The Movie Database API (tmdb)



Proposal 2
We aim to design a web application that takes in a user’s YouTube search/watch history and designs a weekly or monthly Spotify
playlist based on these searches that is delivered to the user through their Spotify account. As many people already use 
YouTube to listen to music or watch music videos, it would be an efficient way for the user to explore more music from the
same or similar artists. When dealing with non-music videos, we will consider the video description, video tags, key words
and video categories to build the playlist. 

APIs:
Youtube Data API
Spotify API
