This is our proposal!

Proposal 1
The web application will serve as a recommendation tool for people going on dates or any other event. Using a picture posted by
the user, the web app will send the image to Google Vision API to detect and return the emotions detected on that particular 
person. The web app will then send these emotions to the Spotify API and Webknox Jokes API to obtain recommendations on the
appropriate music or joke.

APIs:
Google Vision API 
Spotify API
Webknox Jokes API



Proposal 2
We aim to design a web application that takes in a userâ€™s YouTube search/watch history and designs a weekly or monthly Spotify
playlist based on these searches that is delivered to the user through their Spotify account. As many people already use 
YouTube to listen to music or watch music videos, it would be an efficient way for the user to explore more music from the
same or similar artists. When dealing with non-music videos, we will consider the video description, video tags, key words
and video categories to build the playlist.
